i need a vad, turn detection, and diarizer
i also need to stream them in chunks to get faster results
Current output is really slow to my liking. will continue tomorrow
I will also work on the recording aspect as well, before proceeding to advanced capabilities. 
i think i might use onnx to speed up model capabilities
